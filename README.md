# Print Spooler
The print spooler is a software program that manages print jobs sent to a printer. It acts as a buffer between the computer and the printer, allowing multiple print jobs to be queued and printed in an orderly fashion. The spooler also provides features such as job prioritization, status monitoring, and error handling.

## Features
- Add print jobs with details (job ID, document name, priority).
- Remove print jobs.
- Display the status of all print jobs.
- Simulate the printing process with a delay.
- Handle job priorities (higher priority jobs are printed first).

## Usage
1. Start the print spooler application.
2. Use the following commands to interact with the spooler:
   - `add <job_id> <document_name> <priority>`: Add a new print job.
   - `remove <job_id>`: Remove a print job.
   - `status`: Display the status of all print jobs.
   - `print`: Simulate the printing process.
   - `exit`: Exit the application.
